            Klimatkollen (Climate Checker) is a Swedish open source platform visualizing

            We believe that data transparency and citizen engagement are key to generating
            the public pressure needed to make sure local governments and companies cut
            emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

            There is a big gap between what companies say and what they actually do, to
